# ADC_PE_single_channel_fixed_iteration

The ADC compute PE, used for evaluating performance. 

Performance verified, results not verified yet (but should be fine).

Predicted Performance:

Set freq=200MHz, achieved freq=181 MHz. 286400001 cycles. -> 286400001 / (181 * 1e6) = 1.58 sec

Real Performance (summary.csv): 1.643 sec
